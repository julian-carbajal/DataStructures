Chatgpt was used alot for debugging. 
    "What is wrong with my code?.."
    "How to iterate over a string in C++"
    "example template for classes in C++"
    "what does std::string(1, c) do?"
    "how to process a file in C++ and projecting it onto an html file"
    "how to create a main file using several cpp files"

code works with docker.
    g++ *.cpp
    ./a.out
